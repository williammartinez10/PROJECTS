     * Here you will monitor the value of the variable "number" as well as the output of each statement to the console.
     * To begin place a breakpoint in the line #10 of code and run debug with g++.exe
     * To go to the next line you will use F10 or the Step Over button in the debugging panel that shows on the top of the screen.
